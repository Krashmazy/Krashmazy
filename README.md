# ðŸš€ Welcome to the Cantina ! You are our Only Hope. ðŸŒŒ

## Greetings, Young Padawan Developer! ðŸ‘‹
I am Alexis, a coding Jedi still learning the ways of the Force. Transmitting my messages from the humble planet of Home, where the syntax is as mysterious as the Force.

## Jedi Apprentice Skills ðŸš¦
- **Programming Force Techniques:** Currently hard learning Python and Java, dabbling in JavaScript (lightsaber assembly still in progress).
- **Frameworks from a Galaxy Far, Far Away:** taking small steps with React, and cautiously approaching Spring Boot (like a Jedi cautious of the Dark Side).
- **Database Mind Tricks:** Learning the basics of MySQL, taming the wild world of MongoDB (I can feel the Force, but the queries are still a mystery).
- **Automatisation:** Learning Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes.

## The Solo Project: [Project Skywalker](https://github.com/Krashmazy/MdpGen/blob/1346c3c71c6e76e4e29cf22f5108c15c38bbfa77/src/PasswordGeneratorGUI.java)
Embark on this solo mission, where bugs are the dark side, and every commit is a step towards becoming a coding Jedi. This is where the training begins.

## Contributions to the Jedi Code
- **Initiate Level: [Project Jedi Training](link_to_your_first_contribution)**
  - Successfully navigated the pull request galaxy. First steps on the path to mastery.

## Chronicles of the Jedi Apprentice
Follow my journey through the Force on [my blog](https://5minactus.fr/), where I share tales of syntax struggles and triumphs over runtime errors. Yoda-level wisdom, coming soon.

## Contact (Use Your Ewok Communicator)
- **Young Jedi Email:** bernealexis@gmail.com (I might reply in Yoda-speak, fair warning)
- **LinkedIn Jedi Padawan Profile:** [Alexis Berne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-berne-626558128/) (where I showcase my humble beginnings)

Feel free to join me on this coding adventure. Together, we'll conquer bugs and reach new coding galaxies. May the Force (and your code) be with you! ðŸŒŒâœ¨
